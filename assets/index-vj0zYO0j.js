This ensures that all the ingredients are 100% natural leaf powders, safe for hair, as well as completely natural. So, instead of using chemical dyes that can damage your hair over time, switch to Herbal Me Hair Colors which are not only completely safe for your hair, but also provide natural benefits.First-time users of Herbal Me Henna may not be able to achieve the desired colour initially if the hair has been chemically treated or dyed earlier. In such a case, this colour will have to be applied 3-4 times or even more depending upon the condition of the hair. But, once the hair starts getting repaired and nourished, the result is long-lasting and without any side effects.Please note that our Blonde hair colors CANNOT turn dark shades of hair into a lighter tone. They CANNOT change the color of black, brown or any other darker shade to a blonde color. This is NOT possible without the use of chemicals. The Blonde colors can only color grey, white or light and naturally blonde hair shades. Applying Plant-Based Hair Colors is an effective and time tested way for covering greys and imparting the desired colour. Henna and herbs application is one of the best natural hair care routine that has been practised over centuries for thick & voluminous hair, way before the invention of synthetic and permanent hair dyes.
